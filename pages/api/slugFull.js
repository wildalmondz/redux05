In the United States, the appreciation and\n        evaluation of wine have evolved into a sophisticated art form, with various types of wine judging events taking\n        center stage. These events not only celebrate the diversity of American wine production but also provide a\n        platform for wine enthusiasts and experts to showcase their discerning palates. In this blog, we delve into the\n        major types of wine judging in the United States, each with its unique characteristics and significance.\n    </p>\n\n<section>\n\n    <div class=\"separator\">\n        <h2>Wine Competitions</h2>\n    </div>\n    <figure class=\"align-left\">\n        <img\n                class=\"landscape\"\n                src=\"https://wildalmonds.com/api/uploads/f2677e00-35b3-43ff-93d0-7ab4e18a7689_wineComp.jpg\"\n                alt=\"benson\">\n        <figcaption class=\"blogFig\">Competitions</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <p>\n        Wine competitions are perhaps the most well-known and accessible type of wine judging in the United States.\n        These events bring together a diverse range of wines from different regions, grape varieties, and winemaking\n        styles. Some of the most prestigious wine competitions include the San Francisco International Wine Competition,\n        the New York International Wine Competition, and the Los Angeles International Wine Competition.\n</p>\n    <blockquote>\"When Wine enters, out goes the Truth.\" \n        -- Benjamin Franklin</blockquote>\n<p >\n    Judges at these competitions evaluate wines blindly, without knowing the producer or brand.

This was much different from the bottling I helped with previously.\n</p>\n<p >\n    Washington’s cooler climate and higher elevation vineyards make it well-suited for growing grapes that are used in\n    sparkling wine production. We are still small potatoes compared to California and Oregon, but production is growing.\n    Several wineries in the state are now producing sparkling wines which are starting to gain recognition and awards.\n    The state is also starting to host sparkling wine festivals and events, which is helping to raise awareness of its\n    sparkling wine offerings. You can be sure that we will be on the lookout for those and will be posting details here\n    at WildAlmonds.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Washington is starting to develop its sparkling wine presence in the industry by focusing on producing high-quality\n    sparkling wines using traditional methods. Winemakers here are experimenting with different grape varieties and\n    techniques to create unique and flavorful sparkling wines that stand out in a crowded market.\n</p>\n</br>\n<div class=\"separator\">\n    <h2>Washington state sparkling wine</h2>\n</div>\n</br>\n<p>\n<figure class=\"align-right\">\n    <img\n            class=\"medium\"\n            src=\"https://wildalmonds.com/api/uploads/ace0e40a-9bf6-4de4-a09b-41629d6a92c8_IMG_7453.jpg\"\n            alt=\"threeofcups1\">\n        <figcaption class=\"blogFig\">Bottling Process</figcaption>\n</figure>\n    There is a growing interest among consumers in the United States for sparkling wines, both imported and domestic.\n    This has created a demand for sparkling wines from regions beyond Champagne, such as Prosecco, Cava, and of course\n    other sparkling wines produced here in Washington.\n    </p>\n    <p>The sales of Prosecco may have contributed to an increased interest in sparkling wine production among Washington\n        State winemakers. However, there are several factors driving this trend, including a focus on producing\n        high-quality wines that are distinct from those produced in other regions and that growing interest in sparkling\n        wines among US consumers.</p>\n    <p>\n        One of the keys to success for Washington's sparkling wine industry has been the use of the traditional method,\n        also known as the méthode champenoise, which involves a secondary fermentation in the bottle. This process\n        produces fine bubbles and a complex flavor profile that is highly prized in sparkling wines. This is the process\n        I got to help with at Three of Cups! We capped the sparkling wine bottles for further fermentation.\n    </p>\n</br>\n    <div class=\"separator\">\n        <h2>Storage... under pressure</h2>\n    </div>\n    <p>\n        The pressure in a bottle or tank for making sparkling wine varies depending on the method of production. The\n        traditional method, used to produce Champagne and many other sparkling wines, involves a secondary fermentation\n        in the bottle. In this method, the wine is bottled with yeast and sugar, which produces carbon dioxide as a\n        byproduct of fermentation. This trapped carbon dioxide creates the bubbles in the wine. I can tell you first\n        hand it smells like strawberry shortcake at this point.\n</p>\n    <p>\n        During secondary fermentation, the pressure in the bottle can reach as high as 6 atmospheres (about 90 pounds\n        per square inch or psi) before the wine is aged for an extended period.\n        In contrast, the Charmat method, used to produce Prosecco and many other sparkling wines, involves a secondary\n        fermentation in a large, pressurized tank. In this method, the pressure in the tank can reach as high as 4\n        atmospheres (about 60 psi) before the wine is bottled under pressure. In both methods, controlling the pressure\n        is essential to producing high-quality sparkling wine with the desired level of carbonation. Too little pressure\n        can result in a wine with few or no bubbles, while too much pressure can lead to explosions or other safety\n        concerns.\n    </p>\n    </br>\n</br>\n    <div class=\"separator\">\n        <h2>Aging to bubble up some excitement</h2>\n    </div>\n    <p>\n        Sparkling wine is typically aged for a minimum of 12 months, but the length of aging can vary depending on the\n        style and quality of the wine. Some high-end Champagnes are aged for several years or even decades. This\n        extended aging on the lees gives the wine a toasty, nutty flavor and a creamy texture.\n</p>\n    <p>\n        For other styles of sparkling wine, such as those made using the Charmat method like Prosecco, where secondary\n        fermentation takes place in large tanks rather than in individual bottles, the aging period may be shorter.\n        These wines may be aged on their lees for a few months or up to a year before being bottled.\n</p>\n    <p>\n        In general, the longer the aging period, the more complex and flavorful the sparkling wine will be. However,\n        aging sparkling wine for too long can cause it to lose its freshness and fruitiness, so winemakers must\n        carefully balance the aging period to achieve the desired flavor profile.\n    </p>\n</br>\n</section>\n    <section style=\"\n    padding-top: 2em;\">\n        <div class=\"separator\"><h2>Effervescence cheers</h2></div>\n<p>\n    <figure class=\"align-left\">\n    <img\n            class=\"medium\"\n            src=\"https://wildalmonds.com/api/uploads/bb8d3f90-450b-4f9a-a132-4870694d1b33_IMG_7456.jpg\"\n            alt=\"3ofcups2\"/>\n    <figcaption class=\"blogFig\">Insert fizzy here</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n        The next step between us and a celebration with bubbles is ‘Riddling’; a process used in the traditional\n        method of making sparkling wine to remove sediment from the wine. This creates a clear, bright final wine. The\n        aging process Three of Cups just started will give the wine its characteristic flavor and aroma, but to remove\n        the lees and clarify the wine, riddling is necessary.\n</p>\n        <p>\n        The riddling process involves gradually turning the bottles and increasing their angle over time. This\n            encourages the lees to settle towards the neck of the bottle. For small productions, this can be done by\n            hand, with the bottles being placed in racks called pupitres and given a quarter turn each day. This process\n            could take several weeks to complete. I think this was the inspiration for the Byrd’s song\n            ‘To everything turn, turn, turn.’\n</p>\n        <p>\n        Once the riddling process is complete, the neck of the bottle is frozen to trap the sediment in a plug of ice.\n            That cap we put on is then removed from the bottle to allow the pressure to eject the frozen sediment in a\n            process called disgorging.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        After disgorging, the bottle is topped up with a mixture of wine and sugar, called the dosage, to adjust the\n            sweetness and flavor of the wine. The winemaker will add a specific amount of sugar to achieve the desired\n            level of sweetness, from extra brut, which has no added sugar, to doux, which is very sweet.\n</p>\n        <p>\n        The bottle is then corked and caged before it is aged further, bottled, or released for sale!\n        </p>\n</br>\n</br>\n<p style=\"\n    padding-left: 2em;\">\n    Big thanks again to <a href=\"https://threeofcups.com/\">Three of Cups!</a>\n</p>\n        </br>\n        </br>\n</section>\n</article>\n</div>",

After\n    some quick introductions, I bolted up with a few resources that had been helping for years. That put me in the\n    bottling truck, which is a semi-trailer full of processing equipment. I made some akward Dad jokes about Laverne and\n    Shirley which I quickly regretted. Not because they weren't funny (there was no expectation of that) but because it\n    squarely put that theme song in my noggin for the next two days!\n</p>\n    <div class=\"separator\">\n<p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/penny-marshall-dead-laverene-shirley-1264112\">From Newsweek: According to the\n        dictionary, \"schlemiel\" refers to \"an unlucky bungler\" while \"schlimazel\" is a \"consistently unlucky person.\"</a>\n</p>\n    </div>\n</br>\n<div class=\"separator\">\n    <h2>Get in the truck!</h2>\n</div>\n</br>\n<p>\n<figure class=\"align-right\">\n    <img\n            class=\"medium\"\n            src=\"https://wildalmonds.com/api/uploads/779f7c03-5bef-4a20-9b5a-54682dbbaed0_IMG_3ofCup01.jpg\"\n            alt=\"threeofcups1\">\n        <figcaption class=\"blogFig\">2020 visit at Three of Cups</figcaption>\n</figure>\n    Entering the truck, the first thing I noticed was how much can go on in that amount of space! It's packed in there.\n    I followed the veterans of the operation to the back not sure which jobs were done in there. A\n    a fellow volunteer named Pam quickly ran us through how the process worked and measured us up for which ones\n    we were interested in. Basically the back of the truck has 4 gigs:\n    <ul>\n        <li><strong>New bottle (goes in)</strong></li>\n        <li><strong>1:</strong> &emsp; Pull case of empty bottles to feeder table</li>\n        <li><strong>2:</strong> &emsp; Dump empty bottles, neck up on the table, visual quality check.

I knew it wouldn't be as easy as it sounded, but I was willing to give it a\n    go. Our first wines would be for Sightglass and right away, an extra challenge is presented. The wines are going to\n    be placed in neck side down. Grip it and flip it.\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</section>\n    <section style=\"\n    padding-top: 2em;\">\n        <div class=\"separator\"><h2>On the \"case\"</h2></div>\n<p>\n    <figure class=\"align-left\">\n    <img\n            class=\"portrait\"\n            src=\"https://wildalmonds.com/api/uploads/17337bcb-f024-4d0e-be06-dac47f71fee9_IMG_3ofcups2.jpg\"\n            alt=\"3ofcups2\"/>\n    <figcaption class=\"blogFig\">Keep on truckin'</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    Once we were set, the operation starts and it's game on.

The nerves were up\n        for the first few cases for certain. After a while though, \"team truck\" found a rhythm and motored\n        right through all 649 cases day one!

We have had several users comment\n    that ‘we love how you’ve added gamification to your platform.’ It’s always a surprising comment for me to hear\n    because I don’t really consider it an effort to make it fun. It should be just built in and central to design or\n    why do it? Gamification sounds like hard work with fun as an afterthought to me.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    A very early use of the platform was for pumpkin carving contest.

                "title": "How I Built This",
                "blog": "</br>\n<p>\n    I am going to keep this down to a single blog post but with references to where I will post more about how I overcame\n    some significant challenges technically.  WildAlmonds fundamentally is about two things: allowing tasters of wine\n    to navigate the enormous choices they have and find their next favorite wine and allowing wineries to connect with\n    those passionate followers.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Early in my career, I had what I would consider to be a software development job contracting at Microsoft. I then\n    had an extended period of risk aversion. Looking back, I had the pieces I needed to try this years ago, but not\n    the timing to take the leap. For those of you that may be interested, this will be a focus of the\n    <a href=\"https://wildalmonds.com/blog/founder/andrewreid\">Founders Blog.</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Alright, now back to how I built WildAlmonds.\n</p>\n</br>\n</br>\n<h2>Javascript/Node</h2>\n<p>\n    <img\n            id=left-image\n            src=\"https://wildalmonds.com/api/uploads/faed6c0d-b2f7-408f-911f-ca035d599c68_javascript.jpg\"\n            alt=\"javascript\"\n    />\n    I needed to lower the barrier to use the programs I knew how to create. In Software Development terms, a Front End.\n    I learned how to make an interactive site that was fast for users to make selections. I was taking Javascript class\n    at the University of Washington and needed a final project. My idea was a game where you guessed where the program\n    would place colors in boxes.\n\n    I had a tendency to have an inferiority complex with programming because I am not the best at math. This final was a\n    nice surprise though as it was well received by the class!! I was happy that I built one of the more complicated\n    projects and had it done on time. On the last day of the Javascript program, being a little disappointed it was\n    over, I asked the instructor what I could be doing next to learn more about Front End development. He recommended\n    React, and I spent my free time over the next two years studying and working on the framework. Again, more fancy\n    terms but in a nutshell, if we get this right, we can build a framework that can scale to different opportunities\n    for wineries.\n</p>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n<h2>Express</h2>\n<img\n        id=right-image\n        src=\"https://wildalmonds.com/api/uploads/ca0c933d-b5b9-47be-84ae-0d1c38a3fccd_express.jpg\"\n        alt=\"express\"\n/>\n<p>\n    This was a really important book that was recommended to me by the instructor. Computer programming that I was using\n    is based on a stack. The stack I wanted to learn was MERN, MySql Express React and Node.\n    Node is what I had learned in class, but Express was something I took up on my own. Express is a middleware that\n    allows what the user sees in the front end to talk to the database at the backend, perform user authentications, and\n    other important glue to put the platform together. When you make a wine selection\n    with WildAlmonds, Express is doing the work to write that to the database behind the scenes.\n</p>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n<h2>React</h2>\n<p>\n    <img\n            id=left-image\n            src=\"https://wildalmonds.com/api/uploads/3143ae58-656b-4d79-925c-64d3e111f083_learnReact.jpg\"\n            alt=\"react\"\n    />\n    This was what I lacked the most; Front End Development experience. I am a firm believer that \"if your data is right,\n    the application will be right\".\n    However, if the users cannot easily navigate the application, the data is not\n    obtained to begin with. I am still learning how users interact with WildAlmonds and appreciate those who are expert\n    level User Experience as a profession. It is a lot harder than it looks and no doubt I will keep learning here. Where I\n    did make nice strides was in the React Router arena and with making most of our content data driven.\n    <br/>\n    <b3>npm create-react-app</b3>\n    WildAlmonds was initally built without this starter app. I called CodeMentors at one point when I was stuck. The\n    resource helping me could not believe I had created my app without it. \"Refactor your code starting from that point\n    so you can get further help easier!\" Oh no! After some very early mornings, I had re-factored the entire app\n    starting from this point.... and have learned enough to not need CodeMentors help.\n</p>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n<h2>MySql</h2>\n<p>\n    <img\n            id=right-image\n            src=\"https://wildalmonds.com/api/uploads/ba582902-8333-465d-aae3-2bdaea3c7a41_mysql.jpg\"\n            alt=\"mysql\"\n    />\n    Now that I knew a bit more of the \"how to display the data\", I could get back to the pieces I had worked with more;\n    data and structuring that data. Not only do I truly enjoy the wine tasting experience, there were strategic reasons\n    that business made sense. It made a nice example for the beginning structure of data for the platform, and from day\n    one it was the sample data I began playing with. The course had been set early! Initially, I built my prototype data\n    into MongoDB, which is a document style database. Mostly because the examples in the Express book used it. After a\n    few months though, I made a big decision to abandon it for MySQL. The data was too relational to support MongoDB and\n    it seemed like it would just be more supportable long term to be in MySQL. This ancient book was my primary\n    reference. I think it served me just fine. Another reason I am happy with choosing MySQL... tried and true!\n</p>\n<h4>AWS</h4>\n<p>\n    It just worked and the cost was low! My career experience includes instance automation for one of the so called\n    \"cloud kings\" and for that reason, setting up in AWS was relatively easy for me.\n</p>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n<h2>Launch!</h2>\n<p>\n    Do you know how long gmail has been in beta form? Well, it has been a minute at least. I think I am facing unique\n    challenges at times, but I find that I fall into the same traps many founders do. Even gmail left itself in beta\n    for years to continue to grow and add meaningful features. </br> Listening to podcasts like How I\n    Built this or the Practical Founders is super helpful for me. All this technical stuff is great, and like a passionate\n    winemaker I love the challenges and fulfillment in creating something. However, we are solidly focused now on user\n    experience. If you are interested in the coding side of this project, I will be posting more about that on the\n    <a href=\"https://wildalmonds.com/blog/founder/andrewreid\">Founders Blog.</a>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    Otherwise, stay tuned for more about how we are working with tasters and wineries!

                "title": "Summer Vacation 2022",
                "blog": "<p>\n    I will be posting about how I built WildAlmonds as promised in another blog. First, I wanted to wrap up what\n    has proven to be a memorable summer.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Underlying all of the activities we fit in was the concern and time given to my Dad who deals daily with Cancer.\n    Diagnosed in 2016 with Multiple Myeloma, we have known that the road would be a tough one for him. He continues to\n    battle and amaze us all with his courage and strength. He was in and out of many local hospitals in July and August.\n    I left my full time employment in July and proudly help both my parents. I'm extremely lucky to be able to do so.\n</p>\n</br>\n<h2>May</h2>\n<p>\n    Here in the Pacific Northwest, the season typically starts after July 4th and this year was little\n    exception. And the unofficial start of summer is Memorial Day weekend, not June 21st. On May 29th, we ventured\n    through the northwest rain to Maltby Wa for the <a href=\"https://www.pecospit.com/trucks\">Picos Pit</a>\n    food truck and whiskey tasting at <a href=\"https://www.jptrodden.com\">JP Trodden</a>.     <img\n        id=left-image\n        src=\"https://wildalmonds.com/api/uploads/6f882593-63d0-4114-aea9-45a444ca69aa_whiskey_go.jpg\"\n        alt=\"jp_whiskey_tasting\"\n/>They have a food truck come to this location but I miss the announcements. Something our platform could help with! This location is about a\n    mile from where I grew up in the 70's and 80's. It is a bit surreal for me to see wineries and distilleries in fields\n    where once were fences, cows and horses. But what an upgrade!! I will absolutely be adding whiskey to the\n    WildAlmonds platform in the near future. We had a rather large group for a tasting and JP Trodden was able to\n    accommodate our party size and the service was excellent! We were able to bring in our BBQ and hatch our summer\n    plans. Pro tip: Make sure you try the Maple Syrup.\n</p>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n<h2>June</h2>\n<h3>Moses Lake</h3>\n<p>\n    Well we can travel to the nice weather! June was a bunch of weekend trips.\n</p>\n<p>\n    First off, we joined the ranks of the AirBnB crowds and\n    rented a great home over in Moses Lake. We found this to be very relaxing and very nice to spend the time with\n    Marissa's family. We arrived just as the rain had subsided there. This was a working trip for me, there were a couple\n    of days I hunkered down in our ( the owners kids?) bedroom to work. It's a bright spot in the COVID world where work\n    has officially become an activity and not a location.\n</p>\n</br>\n<h4>Lake Wenatchee</h4>\n<p>\n    The following weekend, we were in the travel trailer for its first trip of the year at Confluence State Park in\n    Wenatchee, Washington. The rain followed us at the end of the weekend, but we got in a fantastic bicycle day\n    before the rain drops found us again. This is a fantastic State Park and we really enjoyed the extra large camping\n    sites. We had heavy rains across the state in May and June, and the day we arrived the Wenatchee River was really\n    high. Flooded into the beach swim area. By our last day, the water had drastically receded leaving a muddy, silty\n    mess! My Uncle and I were out for a walk with the dogs early in the morning and noticed the only other person at the\n    beach was a man setting up a rather large device with car batteries. Our guess was a fountain but it seemed\n    a stretch. I walked up, \"Ok! You got me. I'll bite. What are you fishing with here with this device!? ...or is it a\n    fountain?\" Super nice inventor who is working on a device to\n    <a href=\"https://www.wenatcheeworld.com/business/underwater-fiber-optic-cable-proposed-for-microsoft-possibly-others/article_fa5f7db0-3495-11ed-985e-d7326499a3b8.html\">bury fiber optic</a>\n    cables underwater in sediment just like what was exposed at the beach! Early prototype but my money is on him.\n    Not going to lie, I wanted to stay and watch. I'm always inspired by people who want to try something different.\n</p>\n<h4>Viva! Las Vegas</h4>\n<p>\n    <img\n            id=right-image\n            src=\"https://wildalmonds.com/api/uploads/d488c53a-13c8-4af1-9a7e-a554b4eb9458_kidsVegas.JPG\"\n            alt=\"2022_vegas\"\n    />\n    We finished off June with another weekend trip to Vegas. The kids took me out for Father's Day steak dinner, we\n    caught the Beatles Love show, hung out at the Flamingo pool and Fremont street. Couldn't have had a better time!\n    Well, had COVID stayed in Vegas that would have been ideal.\n</p>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n<h2>July</h2>\n<p>\n    Remember that bit about my Dad and Multiple Myeloma? That would consume our July and the beginning of his August.\n    It reared its ugly head just when I was dealing with COVID. Could not have been timed worse. When I was really\n    needed to be there for my folks, I was out of commission. Isolated to my home office, I was glad to have the extra\n    time to wrap up with my employer. It also gave me the time to investigate how I could afford to spend more time\n    caring for my Dad. Being able to spend time with him became the focus for the month, and we are so grateful that it\n    worked out that he's still able to be at his home with us. We cut our annual week in Chelan down to just a few days\n    which meant no wine tasting this year.\n</p>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n<h2>August</h2>\n<h4>Back home! ...and North to Alaska</h4>\n<p>\n    My Dad returned back home after those extended hospital stays. Just as we headed off to Alaska!\n    <img\n            id=left-image\n            src=\"https://wildalmonds.com/api/uploads/5a58fc1e-2616-4272-824d-698d09504e02_alaska_01.jpg\"\n            alt=\"alaska_01\"\n    />\n    Marissa and I had the cruise planned for over a year. Thankfully we were able to pull it all together. We sailed\n    with Princess and had stops in Ketchikan, Juneau, and Icy Point Straight. </br><p><h5>Ketchikan</h5><p>Having no\n    excursion planned, we bartered for a deal on a trolley right off the boat. </p></br><h5>Juneau</h5><p>This was where\n we had our planned Bike and Brew excursion and that gave us something to do off the ship. I have a GoPro that I need to process\nfor the bike ride. The weather was spectacular and seeing a glacier up close was definitely worth the trip. The Brew portion was a small \ntasting of Alaskan Brewery beers. Places where WildAlmonds would be useful are never far away and it’s always encouraging to get out where the platform fits.\n    </p><h5>Icy Point Straight</h5><p>Would have rather seen Skagway rather than Icy Point but... rock slide in Skagway\n    meant we were diverted. We walked around the point, found not much to see and were back to the ship rather quickly.\n    I guess I'll need to come back again! Surely I missed something great in Skagway, dang it!\n    </p></br> They say that Alaska is the most re-visited destination in the world. I fit that description as this was\n    my fourth trip to the final frontier. The shows on the cruise ship were beyond our expectations, the food was\n    abundant, and the company was spectacular. </br>Next time, electric bikes… it's a vacation! Or perhaps beer and brew\n    instead of bikes and brew</p>\n</p>\n</br>\n<h2>September</h2>\n<h4>North again to... Canada!?</h4>\n<p>\n    We had a few weekend trips for the month close to home. We really enjoy using the little trailer, so we like to\n    find trips to take with it when we can. The Pacific Northwest is so nice in the late summer it feels a shame to not\n    get the most out of the spectacular weather.\n</p><h5>Port Townsend</h5>\n    <p>\n    My extended family has had a place across from Port Townsend since before I was born. My Grandparents lived nearby\n    in Port Hadlock.\n        <img\n            id=left-image\n            src=\"https://wildalmonds.com/api/uploads/77b1f44a-dabd-45b1-a906-5e4f1f17600c_pt_townsend2.JPG\"\n            alt=\"pt_townsend\"\n        />\n    I think that is a big reason I've always feel drawn back to this cool little city. When I had a Ducati, I would\n    make a weekend day of it exploring the area. That's when I found\n    <a href=\"https://portofpt.com/point-hudson-marina-rv-park/\">Port Hudson Marina and RV Park.</a> I'm really glad we\n    got to finally stay here. The sites are close, but the view is amazing! We missed dinner at\n    <a href=\"http://www.docsgrill.com/\">Doc's Marina Grill</a> because we didn't make a reservation. I've eaten here\n    before and it's amazing. Chalk the miss up to life experience. If you plan to go, make a reservation. Dang it!\n    <p>\n    We found some pizza in town at <a href=\"https://www.pizzafactory.com/porttownsend/\">Pizza Factory</a> and enjoyed\n    the endless scenery from the campsite. We lost count of the amount of cruise ships that we watched move on out to\n    Alaska. Just weeks before, we had been in that line of ships. Summer moves fast for sure.\n    </p>\n</br> </p>\n</br>\n<h5>Victoria</h5>\n    We had a short stop here on our cruise, but we sure enjoyed having an extended stay.\n    <img\n        id=right-image\n        src=\"https://wildalmonds.com/api/uploads/87826ee6-a760-4c83-8300-4e9d2e09bd6f_victoria_bc.jpg\"\n        alt=\"victoria\"\n    />\n    We parked the old Dodge at the ferry terminal in Port Angeles and walked on the Black Ball Ferry for the weekend.\n    Unfortunately the smoke found us about half way through the trip. What a surprise to find that the smoke was due to\n    a wildfire in our home county of Snohomish in Washington State. Nearly into October and that smoke persists.\n    Regardless, we got our steps in on this trip! We saw the <a href=\"http://www.thecastle.ca/\">Craigdarroch Castle</a>,\n    the <a href=\"https://www.butchartgardens.com/\">Butchart Gardens</a> the spectacular downtown district and\n    waterfront. What a colorful, fun place to get away. Was a bit sureal to be there just after the Queen passed as\n    there were several tributes, news coverage and other events marking the occasion. She was at the helm for nearly\n    half of Canada's existence.\n</p>\n</br>\n<p>\n    I fortunately (or unfortunately) I do find inspiration when I have downtime. Try as I might, I still found new ideas\n    that would come to me or solutions to old problems. The iPad is never too far away and I do my best to jot down the\n    inspiration and get back to relaxing.\n</p>\n</br>\n    Hope you all had a wonderful summer break and are ready to tackle those challenges and hit those goals. If you are\n    fortunate enough to have your trips upcoming, may you find them to be as much or more amazing. I am looking\n    forward to making improvements in the coming months. Perhaps some from the ideas you help me identify? Drop me a\n    line.</br> andrew.reid@wildalmonds.com",

WildAlmonds previous blog functionality was limited to a single library. As always, we have been actively listening to what tasters of wine and wineries are lacking. Over and over, the wineries we spoke with needed a much easiler way to share exciting news with their customers. Tasters of wine greatly appreciated how easily they could find the wines themselves and provide comments on their favorites. </p><p><br></p><p>This latest release provides just that! By cycling through the company names above, you'll be able to get their newest blogs and videos if they are available. </p><p><br></p><p>We couldn't be more excited to bring you news here about the fine wines of Woodinville and beyond. Please expore the blog and let us know what else we can do to make discovering new wines a breeze. </p><p><br></p><p>Signup by subscribing to our newsletter to find the products of these great wineries and let us know what else we can provide.  </p>",

Reviews are becoming more and more critical to business and product offerings... and more advanced too with compaines using Machine Learning and AI. Here at WildAlmonds we have always been intrigued by Ominchannel marketing defined as \"the denoting or relating to a type of retail that integrates the different methods of shopping available to consumers (e.g., online, in a physical store, or by phone).\" WildAlmonds allows customers to browse your products online, then catch them at the point of experience for a review unlike any other.",

                "blog": "When I go wine tasting with friends, we naturally rank the wines top to bottom. It seems to be a natural way to order like items. The initial version of WildAlmonds included only that option. I thought that it was important to be able to keep track of that ranking quickly and easily, hence the drag and drop. It also had to look good on a cell phone and be usable with one hand. When out tasting the wine, experience, friends, and wine staff are the most important. We enhance those points for the user, so easy was the goal. Initial trials were great, but we quickly heard that adding the option for notes for each item was a desire. Some wanted to spend more time in WildAlmonds and get to the value of why they made the rankings they did. There were some strong considerations regarding adding that note functionality; would it seem to in depth to use it? How could we design notes to fit on a small screen like a phone? Being fun is job number one. It came down to the value it would add to those who do want that extra detail on their experience. The ability to capture in depth details if one wanted provided a service that was well worth the effort. We are really happy with how that turned out and are excited to hear how you like it too.",
