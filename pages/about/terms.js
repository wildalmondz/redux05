                permissive, but rather mandatory in nature. You hereby waive the right to
                any objection of venue, including assertion of the doctrine of forum non
                conveniens or similar doctrine.
                <br />
                c) ARBITRATION: In case of a dispute between the Parties relating to or
                arising out of this Agreement, the Parties shall first attempt to resolve
                the dispute personally and in good faith. If these personal resolution
                attempts fail, the Parties shall then submit the dispute to binding
                arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in the following county:
                Snohomish. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, and
                such arbitrator shall have no authority to add Parties, vary the
                provisions of this Agreement, award punitive damages, or certify a lass.
                The arbitrator shall be bound by applicable and governing Federal law as
                well as the law of the following state: Washington. Each Party shall pay
                their own costs and fees. Claims necessitating arbitration under this
                section include, but are not limited to: contract claims, tort claims,
                claims based on Federal and state law, and claims based on local laws,
                ordinances, statutes or regulations. Intellectual property claims by the
                Company will not be subject to arbitration and may, as an exception to
                this sub-part, be litigated. The Parties, in agreement with this sub-part
                of this Agreement, waive any rights they may have to a jury trial in
                regard to arbitral claims.
                <br />
                d) ASSIGNMENT: This Agreement, or the rights granted hereunder, may not be
                assigned, sold, leased or otherwise transferred in whole or part by You.
                Should this Agreement, or the rights granted hereunder, by assigned, sold,
                leased or otherwise transferred by the Company, the rights and liabilities
                of the Company will bind and inure to any assignees, administrators,
                successors, and executors.
                <br />
                e) SEVERABILITY: If any part or sub-part of this Agreement is held invalid
                or unenforceable by a court of law or competent arbitrator, the remaining
                parts and sub-parts will be enforced to the maximum extent possible. In
                such condition, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full
                force.
                <br />
                f) NO WAIVER: In the event that We fail to enforce any provision of this
                Agreement, this shall not constitute a waiver of any future enforcement of
                that provision or of any other provision. Waiver of any part or sub-part
                of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any other part or
                sub-part.
                <br />
                g) HEADINGS FOR CONVENIENCE ONLY: Headings of parts and sub-parts under
                this Agreement are for convenience and organization, only. Headings shall
                not affect the meaning of any provisions of this Agreement.
                <br />
                h) NO AGENCY, PARTNERSHIP OR JOINT VENTURE: No agency, partnership, or
                joint venture has been created between the Parties as a result of this
                Agreement. No Party has any authority to bind the other to third parties.
                <br />
                i) FORCE MAJEURE: The Company is not liable for any failure to perform due
                to causes beyond its reasonable control including, but not limited to,
                acts of God, acts of civil authorities, acts of military authorities,
                riots, embargoes, acts of nature and natural disasters, and other acts
                which may be due to unforeseen circumstances.
                <br />
                j) ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS PERMITTED: Electronic communications are
                permitted to both Parties under this Agreement, including e-mail or fax.
